# MATLAB Code Explanation

## Aim
To perform and visualize the convolution of two discrete-time sequences, `x[n]` and `h[n]`, using two different methods: matrix-based convolution and direct method convolution.

## Theory
Convolution is a mathematical operation used in signal processing to combine two sequences, such as an input signal and a system's impulse response, to obtain the output sequence. For two discrete-time sequences \( x[n] \) and \( h[n] \), the convolution result \( y[n] = x[n] * h[n] \) represents the output of the system when the input sequence \( x[n] \) is passed through the system with impulse response \( h[n] \).

In this code:
- **Matrix Method**: A circulant matrix of the sequence `h[n]` is generated by shifting `h[n]` circularly for each row, allowing for convolution using matrix multiplication.
- **Direct Method**: MATLABâ€™s built-in circular convolution function `cconv` is used to compute the convolution directly.

### Steps Involved:
1. **Matrix Convolution**:
   - Pad the sequences `x` and `h` to the same length.
   - Create a circulant matrix for the sequence `h` using circular shifts.
   - Multiply this matrix with the sequence `x` to obtain the convolution result.

2. **Direct Method**:
   - Use MATLAB's `cconv` function to directly compute the circular convolution of `x` and `h`.

3. **Plotting**:
   - The input sequences `x[n]` and `h[n]` as well as the convolution result `y[n]` are plotted to visualize the operation.
