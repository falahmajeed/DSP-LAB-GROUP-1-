# Signal Representation in MATLAB

## Aim
To represent and observe various types of signals, including step, impulse, ramp, sine, square, sawtooth, and exponential signals, in both continuous and discrete forms using MATLAB.

## Theory
In signal processing, different types of signals are used to model and analyze systems. The following are the types of signals represented in this MATLAB code:

1. **Step Signal**: A step signal transitions from zero to one at a specified point (usually t=0). It is used to represent a sudden change in the system.

2. **Impulse Signal**: An impulse signal is a signal that contains all energy at a single point in time (usually at t=0). This idealized concept is represented in a discrete form and approximated in continuous form.

3. **Ramp Signal**: A ramp signal is a signal that increases linearly with time, starting from zero at a specified point (usually t=0). It is often used to simulate a constant acceleration.

4. **Sine Wave**: A sine wave is a periodic signal, typically used to represent oscillatory behavior in systems. It has applications in AC signals and wave analysis.

5. **Square Wave**: A square wave alternates between high and low states with a fixed frequency. It is a fundamental waveform used in digital and timing signals.

6. **Sawtooth Wave**: A sawtooth wave linearly rises and sharply drops at a fixed interval. It has applications in analog and digital signal processing.

7. **Exponential Signal**: An exponential signal, typically a decaying exponential, shows exponential growth or decay, often used to represent processes that decay over time.

Each of these signals is plotted in continuous and discrete forms, demonstrating the similarities and differences between the two types.
