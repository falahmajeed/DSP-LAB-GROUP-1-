# Convolution Methods in MATLAB: Overlap-Add and Overlap-Save Techniques

## Aim
To implement the overlap-add and overlap-save methods for block convolution of two sequences using MATLAB.

## Theory

In digital signal processing, the convolution of two sequences is a fundamental operation. When dealing with long sequences, it becomes computationally expensive to directly compute the convolution. Instead, we can use block-based methods, such as the **Overlap-Add** and **Overlap-Save** methods, which break the sequences into smaller blocks for efficient processing.

### Overlap-Add Method
The overlap-add method divides the input sequence into blocks, convolves each block with the impulse response, and then adds overlapping segments of the result. This method requires padding the input and filter sequences to ensure that the output is computed correctly.

1. **Block Partitioning**: The input sequence is divided into blocks of a specific length.
2. **Convolution and Overlapping Addition**: Each block is convolved with the filter, and overlapping results are added to form the final output sequence.

### Overlap-Save Method
The overlap-save method also divides the input sequence into blocks, but it differs in how overlapping segments are handled. Here, the previous output block overlaps with the current block, and only non-overlapping portions are saved.

1. **Block Partitioning**: The input sequence is divided with overlapping blocks to capture the continuity between segments.
2. **Convolution and Segment Saving**: Each block is convolved with the filter, but only the non-overlapping portion of the output is saved, forming the final output sequence.

## MATLAB Code Explanation

The MATLAB code provided below implements both the overlap-add and overlap-save methods.

### Steps in the Code

1. **Input and Filter Sequence Initialization**: Define input sequence `x` and filter sequence `h`.
2. **Length Calculation and Padding**: Determine lengths of the sequences, and pad as necessary to ensure correct convolution output.
3. **Block Partitioning**:
   - In both methods, the sequence `x` is split into blocks of length equal to the filter length.
   - In the overlap-add method, blocks are partitioned with zero-padding to manage overlap.
   - In the overlap-save method, blocks are overlapped and only the valid, non-overlapping portion of each convolution result is stored.
4. **Circular Convolution for Each Block**: Apply circular convolution to each block of `x` with `h`.
5. **Result Combination**:
   - In the overlap-add method, overlapping sections are added to build the final output.
   - In the overlap-save method, only the non-overlapping portions are retained to form the final output sequence.

## Conclusion
The overlap-add and overlap-save methods are efficient techniques for implementing long convolutions in digital signal processing. By breaking down the sequences into blocks and using circular convolution, these methods optimize the computation while managing sequence length and memory usage effectively.
